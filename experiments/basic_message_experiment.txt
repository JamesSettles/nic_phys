Experiment: Sending basic bit messages
This experiment tests how we can send basic bit messages unidirectionally.

Motivation: 
We need to establish an ability to send basic messages between devices before we can
expand to sending more complex messages, potentially across multiple devices

Experimental Setup: 
Two pi's, two NIC's, port 1 xmit connected to port 1 recv using two wires
A python library that initializes communocation, receives and sends a message.

Expected Results:
We expect that the sending pi (a) will send a startup code to the revceiving pi (b) 
will read this code and begin listening. B will then send the "I'm listening" message
to a. When a revceives this it will send the message, will b will read in and then 
print to the command line. 

Update 9/28:
Currently we aren't receiving our expected results. We have gotten the capability of ensuring
a msg is ready to be sent the "hi" from both sides is received and we have created packets to send messages
but it doesn't seem like the msg is being decoded correctly. I suspect this has something to do with clock sync,
tomorrow will look into that more

Results:
