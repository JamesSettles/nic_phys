Experiment: Sending basic bit messages
This experiment tests how we can send basic bit messages unidirectionally.

Motivation: 
We need to establish an ability to send basic messages between devices before we can
expand to sending more complex messages, potentially across multiple devices

Experimental Setup: 
Two pi's, two NIC's, port 1 xmit connected to port 1 recv using two wires
A python library that initializes communocation, receives and sends a message.

Expected Results:
We expect that the sending pi (a) will send a startup code to the revceiving pi (b) 
will read this code and begin listening. B will then send the "I'm listening" message
to a. When a revceives this it will send the message, will b will read in and then 
print to the command line. 

Results:
